Cleave splits a document into a set of words and those words into characters.  The definition of "words" and "characters" comes from the Unicode standard as implemented by IBM's ICU library.  All "words" that contain no letters or digits, such as punctuation, are removed from the text.  The input is processed one line at a time and words are assumed to not cross line boundaries.  The output is one "character" followed by a newline character (0x0A).  The end of a word is marked with a space (0x20) followed by a newline.  The end of the line is marked by a single newline character.  Empty lines are output unchanged.
