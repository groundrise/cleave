Cleave splits a document into a set of words and those words into characters.  The definition of "words" and "characters" comes from the Unicode standard as implemented by IBM's ICU library.  All "words" that contain no letters or digits, such as punctuation, are removed from the text.  The input is processed one line at a time and words are assumed to not cross line boundaries.  The output is one "character" followed by a newline character (0x0A).  The end of a word is marked with a space (0x20) followed by a newline.  The end of the line is marked by a single newline character.  Empty lines are output unchanged.

There is an alternative word splitting mode called "whitespace".  In this mode, words are broken up by the occurrence of any whitespace character (as defined by java.lang.Character.isWhitespace).  This mode is useful in cases where some "words" are combinations of punctuation marks and letters and numbers.  For example in twitter data it is common to find text like: "running is #fun".  If parsed with the Unicode parser, the "#" symbol would be treated as a word by itself and filtered out.  With the whitespace parser "#fun" is treated a word.  In this mode, all punctuation, regardless of where it occurs, is output.
